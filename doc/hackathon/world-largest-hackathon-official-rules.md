##### Project Requirements

* What to Create: Entrants must build a NEW application primarily with Bolt.new (each a “Project”). The Project can be built completely with Bolt.new or significantly started on Bolt.new as determined by Sponsor, in its sole discretion. The publicly deployed version of the Project interface must include a badge that highlights that it is built with Bolt.new (see [guidance here](https://worldslargesthackathon.devpost.com/details/badgeguidelines)).  
  * Further Clarity added May 30\. While we recognize that not every part of the development process may be ideally suited to Bolt, the core functionality and final experience must run within Bolt. A light degree of flexibility is allowed, but the focus must remain on showcasing Bolt as the primary platform.  
  * What This Means:  
  * Primary Development in Bolt:  
    * The initial structure and main development must begin in Bolt.new.  
    * Projects must demonstrate meaningful use of Bolt’s capabilities and be functional entirely within the Bolt environment.  
  * External Tools (Allowed in Support Roles):  
    * Tools like Figma, ChatGPT, and other AI/code assistants may be used for idea development, design, prototyping, or generating isolated code snippets.  
    * Use of other platforms is permitted only in areas where Bolt is currently less suited—this should be kept minimal and clearly documented.  
  * Badge Requirement:  
    * The final, submitted project must include the “Built on Bolt” badge.  
  * Project Review & Evaluation:  
    * While evaluation may involve some subjectivity, judging will prioritize submissions that are clearly and primarily built on Bolt.  
    * Creative use of Bolt is encouraged, but the project should still be a representative example of what Bolt can do today.  
* Challenge Requirements: If your Project also meets any one or more of the following Challenge Requirements it may be eligible for the applicable Challenge Prizes.   
  * Make More Money Challenge: Use the RevenueCat mobile SDK and RevenueCat Paywall Builder to acquire subscribers in your mobile Bolt.new app.  
  * Custom Domain Challenge: Use Entri to get an IONOS Domain Name and publish your Bolt.new app on the domain.  
  * Blockchain Challenge: Build an app in Algorand where blockchain powers trustless payments, verifiable data, user-owned identity, or programmable digital assets—all with speed, simplicity, and global scale.  
  * Conversational AI Video Challenge: Use Tavus to bring real-time AI video agents to your Bolt.new app.  
  * Voice AI Challenge: Use ElevenLabs to make your Bolt.new app conversational.  
  * Deploy Challenge: Use Netlify to deploy your full-stack Bolt.new application.  
  * Useless Sh\!t Challenge: Use Reddit’s Developer Platform x Bolt to bring your wackiest, weirdest, and silliest ideas to Reddit in the form of a game.  
  * Startup Challenge: Use Supabase to prep your Bolt.new project to scale to millions.  
* Functionality: The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.  
* New Projects Only: Projects must be newly created by the Entrant after the start of the Hackathon Submission Period.   
* Third Party Integrations: If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs and/or data, Entrant must be authorized to use them in accordance with any terms and conditions or licensing requirements of the tool.

##### Submission Requirements

##### 5\. Submission Modifications

Draft Submissions 

Prior to the end of the Submission Period, you may save draft versions of your submission on Devpost to your portfolio before submitting the Submission materials to the Hackathon for evaluation. 

Modifications

After the Submission Period, the Sponsor and Devpost may permit you to modify part of your Submission after the Submission Period for the purpose of adding, removing or replacing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification being what the Sponsor and Devpost permits. 

#####  

##### 6\. Judges & Criteria

Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”). Judges may be employees of the sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the sponsor. 

Stage One) The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the Project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably used Bolt.new to build the project in the Hackathon.

Stage Two) All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

* Potential Impact  
  How big of an impact could the Project have? How meaningful is the problem that the Project is tackling and how well does it solve it and deliver value? How will this Project resonate to the masses or how viral might this Project become?  
* Quality of the Idea  
  How creative and unique is the project? How much of this Project likely already exists in some capacity? Is the problem this Project is tackling, already solved by other offerings in a similar way? How much does the Project innovate or improve on existing solutions?  
* Technological Implementation  
  Does the project demonstrate quality software development? Does the project leverage Bolt.new offering in an interesting or advanced way? How well thought out is the infrastructure and execution of the code?  
* Design  
  Is the user experience and design of the project well thought out? Is there a balanced blend of frontend and backend in the software?

The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.

Tie Breaking 

For each Prize listed below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions’ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.

 

##### 7\. Intellectual Property Rights

All Submissions remain the intellectual property of the individuals or organizations that developed them. By submitting an entry, entrants agree that the Sponsor will have a fully paid, non-exclusive license to use such entry for judging the entry. Entrants agree that the sponsor and Devpost shall have the right to promote the Submission and use the name, likeness, voice and image of all individuals contributing to a Submission, in any materials promoting or publicizing the Hackathon and its results, during the Hackathon Period and for three years thereafter.

Sponsor and Administrator reserve the right in their sole discretion to disqualify any individual or Entrant if it finds to be actually or presenting the appearance of tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Hackathon or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in a manner that is inappropriate, unsportsmanlike, not in the best interests of this Hackathon, or a violation of any applicable law or regulation.  
3. Any attempt by any person to undermine the proper conduct of the Hackathon may be a violation of criminal and civil law. Should the Sponsor or Administrator suspect that such an attempt has been made or is threatened, they reserve the right to take appropriate action including but not limited to requiring an Entrant to cooperate with an investigation and referral to criminal and civil law enforcement authorities.  
4. If there is any discrepancy or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the Official Rules and disclosures or other statements contained in any Hackathon materials, including but not limited to the Hackathon Submission form, Hackathon Website, or advertising, the terms and conditions of the Official Rules shall prevail.  
5. The terms and conditions of the Official Rules are subject to change at any time, including the rights or obligations of the Entrant, the Sponsor and Administrator. The Sponsor and Administrator will post the terms and conditions of the amended Official Rules on the Hackathon Website. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any amendment will become effective at the time specified in the posting of the amended Official Rules or, if no time is specified, the time of posting.  
6. If at any time prior to the deadline, an Entrant or prospective Entrant believes that any term in the Official Rules is or may be ambiguous, they must submit a written request for clarification.   
7. The Sponsor or Administrator’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. Should any provision of these Official Rules be or become illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction whose laws or regulations may apply to an Entrant, such illegality or unenforceability shall leave the remainder of these Official Rules, including the Rule affected, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unaffected and valid. The illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest and best reflects the Sponsor’s intention in a legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.  
8. Excluding Submissions, all intellectual property related to this Hackathon, including but not limited to copyrighted material, trademarks, trade-names, logos, designs, promotional materials, web pages, source codes, drawings, illustrations, slogans and representations are owned or used under license by the Sponsor and/or Administrator.
